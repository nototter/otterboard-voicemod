# otterboard-voicemod
a soundboard made to work with voicemod, therefore changing the limit of 3-5 sounds to an infinite amount with a simple python script

this is a simple python script (that can use some work i must say) that uses voicemod's WDM line to play .wav audio files, while trying to keep simplicity
use config.json to mess and add keybinds, or use the programs built in binds to add a song

`CTRL + N` to stop current playing songs (this is changeable using `ctrl+n!stop` in config.json

`CTRL + SHIFT + Z + Y` to add a .wav file

`CTRL + SHIFT + Z + R` to remove a sound

`CTRL + SHIFT + Z + V` to change volume

feel free to post issues you have with this, and also feel free to contribute
